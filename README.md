ðŸ“¦ Inventory Management System for FreshMart Retail â€“ Project Overview
FreshMart Retail, a local grocery store chain, seeks to enhance its operational efficiency by implementing a robust Inventory Management System (IMS). The objective of this system is to streamline inventory control processes across all store locations, ensuring optimal stock levels, minimizing waste, and improving overall supply chain visibility.

This system will serve as a centralized platform to track grocery stock in real-time, monitor purchase and sales activities, and prevent both overstocking and shortages. By automating critical inventory functions and providing data-driven insights, the IMS will support better decision-making and elevate customer satisfaction.
